# Sentimental-Analysis-covid19
In this project, we use a dataset consisting of the data, related to tweets from 24th July 2020 to  30th august 2020 with covid-19 hashtags. We will use python to apply sentimental analysis over a certain period. We labeled the tweets as Positive, Negative, and neutral. We then visualize the results to see people's reactions on Twitter.

The steps are as followed,
1)importing the dataset 

2)preprocessing and preparing our dataset for sentimental analysis

3)visualizing most common words using a bar chart

4)NLTK module to produce polarity scores for each tweet  

5)visualize results of our analysis using the line chart
